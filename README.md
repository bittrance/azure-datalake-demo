# Azure Demos

This repository contains various explorations of Azure resources and their capabilities. These are generally not maintained once created and so may rot over time.

- [Azure Datalake demo](datalake-demo/): Demonstrates the power of Azure Synapse to analyze a large JSON dataset in-place in Azure Blob storage.
- [Azure IoT Hub demo](iot-storage-eventhub-demo/): Demonstrate how to insert messages into an IoT Hub and accumulate them on both an Azure Storage Account and an Azure EventHub.
